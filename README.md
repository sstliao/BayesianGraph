# BayesianGraph

## Introduction
This repository contains the coding for Bayesian analysis of non-Gaussian processes on undirected graphs. The codes are summarized in different orders suggesting different functionals in conducting the Bayesian analysis of the non-Gaussian process on undirected graphs.

## Import required modules
This can be founded in **/modules**

## Spectral decomposition of graph Laplacian
**/Graph_wavelet** contains coding to generate graph wavelets in characterizing the spectral structure of undirected graphs.


## multi-stage-lasso for priors of variance parameters
In **/prior_var**, one may find the coding to obtain priors for variance parameters: $\boldsymbol \sigma^2=\{\sigma^2_0, \sigma^2_1, ..., \sigma^2_J\}$ and $\tau^2$


## MCMC algorithm
**/MCMC_analysis** includes two files, showing the MCMC sampling algorithm, and chain and prediction performance evaluation.


## Example
**/test** include a sample coding showing the simulation
